 # Tasks Breakdown
 1. Design
    - Create a list of Functional and Non-Functional requirements for this project
    - Create at least 2 UML Diagrams to explain how the system will work
 2. Server Setup
    - Create an Experess.JS server
    - Configure EJS as the View Engine
 3. Create Partials
    - Develop header and footer partials for consistent layout
 4. Home Page Template
    - Create a Template to display a list of blog posts
 5. Individual post template
    - Design a template to show the full blog post content
 6. Routing
    - Implement Routes for the home page and individual posts
    - Pass the data to the templates
 7. Styling
    - Add basic CSS to improve the appearance of your blog
 8. Testing
    - Run the Server and verify functionality in the Browser
 9. Documentation
    - Write Documentation for each step taken, making sure to reference back to the requirements gathered in Design.
    - Your documentation should feature a section on testing, in this section, you should justify the kind of testing you are doing (exhaustive, pseudo-exhaustive, etc...), and show proof of testing the application through testing tables
    - JSDoc Commenting is expected throughout the code as part of the Documentation

  ## Key EJS Concepts to be used
  | Type of Concept | Reason                                                |
  | :---------------| :---------------------------------------------------- |
  | <% %>           | For JavaScript Logic (Loops, COnditionals)            |
  | <%= %>          | For Outputting Escapted HTML                          |
  | <%- %>          | For Outputting Unescaped HTML Routes to EJS templates |

*Passing variable from Express routes to EJS Templates*

## Expected Outcome
A functioning blog with home page listing all posts and individual pages for each post using reusable EJS components and styled with CSS

### Extension Ideas
- Add a Form to create new blog posts
- Implement a Tagging System
- Create a search functionality
